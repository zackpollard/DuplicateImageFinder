# Duplicate Image Finder
This is a simple Java tool that I threw together in order to rid my life of duplicate images (for the most part).

##Usage
1. Download jar file from the jar folder in this repository.
2. Put jar file in the folder you would like to search for duplicates.
3. Run jar file and wait for window to appear with results, for a large amount of files this could take a while.
