# Duplicate Image Finder
This is a simple Java tool that I threw together in order to rid my life of duplicate images (for the most part).

## Usage
1. Download jar file from 
[here.](http://ci.zackpollard.pro/job/Duplicate%20Image%20Finder/lastBuild/pro.zackpollard.duplicateimagefinder$DuplicateImageFinder/artifact/pro.zackpollard.duplicateimagefinder/DuplicateImageFinder/1.0-SNAPSHOT/DuplicateImageFinder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)   
2. Put jar file in the folder you would like to search for duplicates.   
3. Run jar file and wait for window to appear with results, for a large amount of files this could take a while.
